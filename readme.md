## 1. Project progress
In the last two weeks (week 7 & 8), our group has finished the research, requirement gathering, basic prototype design, and paper prototype user testing. 
### 1.1 Research
In order to understand why neighbourhood relationship become alienated, we found out some information about neighbour relationship in the government statistics and academic paper. It turns out that less than half of the apartment residents consider their neighbours friends (Stevens, 2015). Another research shows that knowing the neighbors is one important component of happiness in Australia (Aisha, 2017). The results of the research support our initial idea that we should design a platform which could help the apartment residents know their neighbors as well as sharing information and items within the neighborhood.
### 1.2 Requirement
Requirements Gathering is an essential way to understand the problem and context. In our project, we used both quantitative and qualitative methods to gather the requirements from the people, including survey, interview and observation. 

In the last two weeks, we made an online survey to collect information about the neighborhood relationship of the apartment residents. We found that more than half of the participants did not know any of their neighbors by name; and one of the biggest reasons why people were not willing to share with neighbors was that they did not know them. Therefore, our application should have the ice-breaking function to help people know their neighbors. 

We also ran an observation session in one apartment to see how many people actually pay attention to the community’s message board. The result shows that most of the people do not check the message board. In this case, there should be a function in our application that could play the role as a message board but in a more convenient and efficient way.
### 1.3 Design
During the last two weeks, we have made a sketch of the layout, a paper prototype, and a draft digital prototype of our application ShareTown. We also ran a paper prototype testing session to collect feedback from the participants (Figure 1).

In the paper prototype testing session, we have one team member to be the photographer, one to be the observer, one to be the interviewer, and the other one to play the application.

We collected lots of suggestions from the users, which were used to improve our digital prototype. The digital prototype was created by using Ai, Sketch, and Flinto (Figure 2). It contains the basic workflow from the sign in / sign up page, to the core functions, like request posting, message checking, and chatting with neighbors.

We printed these pages out and used them to run a paper prototype testing session. We got some useful feedback from the participants and made a list of things that could be further improved in the following weeks.

In this document, we will discuss our current work and re-plan future milestones based on what we did between week 7 and 8. All team member will report their own work regarding the project individually.
## 2. Individual work
### 2.1 Vincent
I am mainly responsible for the designing part in our project. In the last two weeks, I first made an initial sketch and structure of the application in terms of the requirements of the project and the needs of the users (Figure 3,4). Then, I made a mockup of our application ShareTown, including the interfaces, icons, forms, and some icons, using Illustrator, Sketch, and Flinto.

In the next two weeks, I will keep refining the digital prototype of our application, including the basic functions, navigation, the interaction between pages, as well as the design of the interface and icons. Also, we will run at least one testing session to collect user feedback on our digital prototype. 

### 2.2 Lily
In the week 7-8, I took part in all design process of our project, especially requirement gathering and user testing. I am responsible for content and logistics so that I prepared the materials for observation and user testing. 

#### Requirement gathering
In order to see neighbour relationship and whether they will see the information on the notice board, I posted a piece of paper on the notice board in the lobby one day and ask how would they describe their relationship with their neighbours (Figure 5). The results showed that there are not many people notice the document (only two responses).

#### User testing 
After Vincent finished the mock-up of ShareTown, we started to prepare the materials that user testing might needs. I printed out the mock-up of the prototype and make sure the size of the prototype is suitable for the user to read and interact with. Then I generated a survey for asking people questions about the tasks, our application, their experience and opinion (The link of the survey: https://goo.gl/forms/937VMHHbeVaRn1A32). After the participant finished the tasks, I guided them to finish the survey and ask them some specific questions such as:
<ul>
<li>Anything (words, buttons, tasks, etc) makes you confused? </li>  
<li>Why did you choose to enter information rather than sign in with Facebook?</li>
</ul>

In the next two weeks, I will run the user testing session on the digital prototype and receive feedback.  
### 2.3 Yonglin
Our team conducted a paper prototype user testing on week 8, and I played as a computer in the testing. After collecting the feedback and responds from the participants, I started to do the analysis on them. Some primary issues are found, such as the confusing words and the chaotic elements. In the coming two weeks, based on the requirement and the feedback, I will start to work on the website with Luck while the digital prototype will be built at the same time. Additionally, I will also join the digital prototype user testing part to observe the interviewees and analyse the results.
### 2.4 Luke
I was involved in the documentation of the user testing on the 12th of September. This entailed filming at taking photographs which have since been compiled and uploaded to the google drive. In the upcoming 2 weeks I will be aiding in the building of the digital prototype, and the testing involved. This will intern give me sufficient insight to then begin work on the applications basic frame eg. HTML and PHP etc.
## 3. Future plan
In the next two weeks, we will run the testing session on our digital prototype and refine the prototype in terms of the feedback from the users. After determining our digital prototype, we will start doing some coding works to develop our final product. Besides, we will keep discussing our idea and improve anything that could be made better.
