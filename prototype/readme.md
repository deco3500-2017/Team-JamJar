  All the stuff here are HTML, CSS and JavaScript with some images and icon material.
  
  Since this application is purely designed for mobile device, we strongly recommend you to browse all of these files in our website on your mobile device. Or you can turn on the inspect and click the toggle device toolbar icon in Chrome to view our website, otherwise there will be some style bugs.
  
  Additionally, this prototype does not cover all functionalities due to the limited building time, but the primary functions and features are built. You can get all details of this product by reading the project proposal and other supplementary materials.
  
  Hopefully, you can enjoy browsing our prototype. Thank you!
