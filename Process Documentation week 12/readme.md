## 1. Project Progress
In the last two weeks (week 11 & 12), our team divided into two sub-team in terms of our tasks and specialities. Vincent and Lily were responsible for preparing the supporting materials for the showcase and the refinement of digital prototype design. Yonglin and Luke were doing the programming job which included the application and website construction, as well as setting up the big screen for assistant displaying. We have finished digital prototype user testing and the construction of the final product at week 13.  
### 1.1 Supporting Materials
The supporting materials should provide the participants a clear and vivid description of our product which play an important role in the showcase. We prepared several supporting materials, including the poster (offering a detailed workflow of the prototype), a number of business cards (presenting the basic info of the product and designers), and some candies. We expected these supporting materials could help the visitors getting a better understanding of what our idea was and how to interact with the system. 
### 1.2 Result of the User Testing
We ran a user testing session during the showcase and invited two participant to do it (due to the time limitation). We asked them to finished a set of tasks while interacting with our ShareTown application and did a short questionnaire after that. 

The result of the user testing showed that the participant could easily find what they were looking for, and thought that the application was easy to understand. That should be due to the refinement of system navigation we did for our prototype. 

Besides, one participant mentioned that he thought there should be a place where allowed the users to post anything they wanted and then put it into different categories. It can be a potential improvement that we are going to do in the future, because the inner logic between the pages and functions of the application should always be carefully considered and organised. 

### 1.3 The Sprint of the Prototype
The date of exhibition is coming soon. In the past two weeks, all of us are focusing on building the final prototype. Because it is impossible and unnecessary to achieve all functionalities, after a short discussion, we have made a decision about the goal of this prototype. The core of our concept should be clearly delivered to the audience in the showcase. Thus, the pages of board and exchange are the priority. It is a trigger to improve the inclusion of the community. Additionally, a big screen in the lobby can enhance the social function of this concept. This is a new coming idea after the discussion with our tutors. The rest of the supplementary functions were still in the plan, such as the community page and profile page. In terms of the other branches of small functions, we designed some dummy page so that participants can have an entire user experience when they interact with our prototype.

## 2. Individual work
### 2.1 Vincent
In the past two weeks, I have refined the digital prototype, and made the supporting material with Lily for the final showcase in week 13. During the demonstration, we invited two participant to take part in a user testing for our final product. 

Our digital prototype has been pretty much done, I just made some tiny changes like the font size and icon design in terms of the feedback we got from the stand ups. For the supporting material, it is supposed to be an important part of the showcase which could demonstrate our idea and design to the participants in a more direct and vivid way. Lily designed most of the showcase poster for our concept, and I made the business cards based on the same color and style of the poster. Besides, we also prepared some lollies for the showcase.



### 2.2 Lily
In the past two weeks, I was responsible for conducting the conference poster and supporting materials with Vincent for the showcase in week 13. Also, we generated a user testing session during the showcase in order to receive some feedback for our final prototype.

The conference poster aim to support us to explain our idea for the presentation at the final showcase. The content included the our concept’s domain, the problem and its solution, and the design process of our project. The design process shows how we develop our project in five stages: doing research about the problems people are facing, defining problem space and design space, ideating our idea, designing prototype and conducting user testing to test out the prototype in order to refine our prototype.

### 2.3 Yonglin
In the past 2 weeks, after the final round of the user testing in this design process, basically, the interactivity and functionality of this product are confirmed. Therefore, I am continuing building the front end. While in the process of building the website which is used for simulating the natural application on the smartphone, I found some different user experiences between them. The limitation of the app-like website is quite obvious. For example, in terms of the backward operation, people prefer to swipe the screen when using an app, while clicking a button to go back on the website. Additionally, the address bar on the top and the menu bar on the bottom is quite annoying. The size of the app should be prefect to the screen when I am designing it. However, the website can be scrolled up and down frequently on the browser. In the coming week, I will just fix some bugs and adjust the style of the website and prepare for the final showcase.
### 2.4 Luke
For the past 2 weeks ive been working on finalizing the user registration with the recent completion of the php script to upload profile pictures . As i was making the php script i have also be incrementally adding already completed scripts to Yonglin’s front end work. currently the php has been added to the community board, transaction board, post message page and post transaction page.

The next weeks will consist of adding the rest of the php to the login, register, profile, and community pages. Once this has been done yonglin and i will also create page that will be designed to be viewed on a larger screen. On Top of this i will also be helping set up our station for the presentation on ShareTown on the 25th of Oct.
