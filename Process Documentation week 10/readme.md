## 1. Project Progress
In the last two weeks (week 9 & 10), our team divided into two sub-team in terms of our tasks and specialities. Vincent and Lily were responsible for the prototype designing and user testing. Yonglin and Luke played to roles of programmers who focused on the construction of the final product. We have finished digital prototype user testing and basic construction of the final product.  
### 1.1 Digital Prototype Designing
In the designing and user testing part, we ran another testing session for our digital prototype to collect the feedback from our target users. We invited four participants to interact with our prototype. All of them were apartment occupants who were the target users of our application. We prepared a list of tasks for them, as well as a survey and a short interview after they finished the tasks. 
### 1.2 Result of the User Testing
Four participants were recruited in our digital prototype user testing. The participants followed the tasks that we assigned. The main findings of the user testing are that the participants didn’t understand the meaning of ‘transaction’. They cannot distinguish the functions of ‘board’ and ‘transaction’. We also found some issues regarding design, such as the design of drop down list, the categories of notifications.   
### 1.3 The Front End and Back End
Based on the first and second round of user testing, which are paper prototype user testing and digital prototype user testing, we collect much useful feedback. While we are using these feedback to iterate our prototype, some of the basic design are confirmed such as the theme and the primary functionalities. Therefore, we can start to build the final product.

Currently, we are using Bootstrap to build the website. Thought our concept initially is a smartphone-based application, we are using the website to achieve the goals in this course because the website is easy to develop while the user experience of the website and application are similar.

In terms of the back end, we have set up a zone and database for this website. Based on the requirement of each function, the items of the tables are created. Besides, after the HTML pages are built, some of them have been transfer to PHP and been linked to the database.

## 2. Individual work
### 2.1 Vincent
I am mainly responsible for the designing part in our project. In the last two weeks, I made some improvements of our digital prototype in terms of the feedback we got from the user testing. 

Specifically, 
<ul>
<li>The “Sign in with Facebook” page was developed so the user could choose either register a new account or connect to their Facebook account.</li>
<li>Users could use the camera to scan QR code in the “Authentication” page to identify themselves.</li>
<li>The “Board” page becomes the home page in the application instead of the “Community” page.</li>
<li>An animation was added into the “Community” page to provide a metaphor of the apartment for the users.</li>
<li>The “search bar” in “Community” page has been refined. Now it supports both horizontal and vertical scrolling.</li>
<li>The “Me” page has been upgraded. A timeline which shows the history of the user’s activities has been designed and implemented. </li>
<li>The interactions between interfaces have been improved. </li>
</ul>

In the next two weeks, I will keep refining the digital prototype of our application, including the basic functions, navigation, the interaction between pages. Meanwhile, we will focus on the construction of the application, including the coding part, and the multiple devices part. 


### 2.2 Lily
In the week 9-10, I participated in generating the digital prototype user testing session aim to get feedback from our target users (who live in an apartment). 

After Vincent finished the digital prototype of ShareTown, we started to prepare the materials that user testing might needs. I created a survey for asking participants basic questions about the tasks and the application (The link of the survey: http://goo.gl/forms/F1MQauOg97U293ig2). The interview questions are more specific for the understanding of navigation, functionalities and interactions, for example, what is your understanding of the name of four navigation such as “transaction”, what you expect to see in “community” page, or why you did/didn’t sign in with your facebook account (privacy issue), etc. After the participant finished the tasks, I guided them to finish the survey and do the interview. Here is the summary of the feedback and our inspiration :

<ul>
<li>Hard to distinguish “board” and “transaction” -> we may combine “board” and “community”
 </li>  
<li>Confused about the name of “transaction” -> we will change the name to “exchange”</li>
<li>Some infographic can be added in “community” </li>
</ul>

In the next two weeks, I will start to prepare the promotional material such as conference poster, etc. and run the user testing session on the digital prototype and receive feedback.   
### 2.3 Yonglin
In the last two weeks, I was focusing on building the HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Basically, I have finished the login and register pages except that some styles need to be modified later. The skeleton of other pages are set, while the second round of the digital prototype is still keeping going. After the final design are confirm, the rest of the pages can be built as soon as possible in the coming weeks.
### 2.4 Luke
For the past 2 weeks i've built the database structures and the php functionality relating to the user session controls, user login and register, pulling and displaying messages stored in the database. Currently these functionalities are basically done with the exception of the user profile picture upload. Over the next 2 weeks i will be working on displaying the user profile pictures and merging my php with Yonglin’s work.
## 3. Future plan
In the next two week, we will keep refining the prototype in terms of the feedback from the users and tutors. Meanwhile, we will finish the construction of our application and get prepared to the showcase in week 13.
